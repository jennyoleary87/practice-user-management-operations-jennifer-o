Practice: SQL - 1 - SQL User Management Operations
&
Practice: SQL - 2 - Advanced SQL Queries - Joins, Subqueries, Grouping

Lesson 1 instructions:
● Insert new user data
● Update existing records
● Delete specific rows
● Write SELECT queries with conditions, sorting, and limits
● A brief README.md (2–3 sentences) describing what you practiced and what you found most challenging.

We practiced fundamental database operations. 
The most challenging aspect was syntax. The lines we wrote seemed backwards from a real conversational sentence.
For example, I might start broader and work inward, saying "Look at users, where the ages are above 60, and delete that range". 

Lesson 2 instructions:
● Use JOIN statements to combine data from multiple tables
● Write GROUP BY queries with aggregate functions like SUM and COUNT
● Apply WHERE and HAVING clauses to filter data
● Practice using SubQueries to create dynamic filters
● A short README.md with a 2–3 sentence reflection:
  ○ What did you learn?
  ○ What was most challenging?
